# Welcome

**SA:MP UDF for AHK v1.1** is an AutoHotkey V1.1 32-bit ASCII library that defines functions
interacting natively with SA:MP, a GTA: San Andreas Multiplayer modification.

It hooks into SA:MP, reads useful player information and exposes methods for interacting with
SA:MP. Usually, it can be used to e.g. send chat commands or chat messages without the overhead
of sending key inputs to the game, and to display your custom text in in-game's chat box.

This library is a fork of [SAMP-UDF-for-AutoHotKey R18](https://github.com/SAMP-UDF/SAMP-UDF-for-AutoHotKey) 
developed by (in original order with original sources)

Thanks to them for developing this library!

Their latest version only supports SA:MP versions `0.3.7-R1`, `0.3.7-R2` and `0.3.DL`. This fork adds
support for the latest SA:MP version `0.3.7-R5` at the time of writing.

:::warning

This library focuses `0.3.7-R5`, so it's possible that bugs are present in older versions (or `0.3.DL`) or new features
are not properly tested in older version. If for whatever reason you need to use older `0.3.7` versions, be careful!
