title: StopAudioStream
---

Stops an audio stream. 
<p> 
Please note that even after stopping an audio stream, the in-game radio may still be locked 
to "User Track Player". You can try to fix this by starting and stopping an audio stream consecutively. 
However, this may not work very consistently and may need multiple iterations 
in order to get the radio working again. If it still does not work, you can 
<ul> 
<li>try lowering radio volume to 0, then resume your game and try to switch. Rinse and repeat 
in combination with stopping and starting audio streams.</li> 
<li>restart your game in doubt.</li> 
</ul> 
</p>

**Returns:** `true` if successful, `false` otherwise

**Signature:**
