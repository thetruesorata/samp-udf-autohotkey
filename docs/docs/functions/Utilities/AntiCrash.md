This function is experimental and its implementation may involve 
    breaking changes or deprecation, or may not be tested throughly. Use at your own risk.

Patch SA:MP to prevent crash reports from being shown, which should suppress most crashes. 
While it may work for older SA:MP versions, this method won't likely work on `0.3.7-R5`.

**Returns:** `false` on failure

**Signature:**

```ahk
